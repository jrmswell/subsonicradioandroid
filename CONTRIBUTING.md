Thank you for taking the time to want to contribute to the Subsonic Radio Android app, first things first, this is not an official project and as such it is not representing [Subsonic Radio](http://subsonicradio.com), this is purely an app for personal use. However there are some guidelines to make it easier for everybody to contribute should you want to:

# 1) Android Studio
I use [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to develop the app, it has some quirks but in order to maximise compatability it might help to use Android Studio although I'm sure it doesn't really matter I'm sort of new to this whole thing

# 2) Making changes
If you would like to make changes, firstly please fork the repo, make your changes and then make a pull request

# 3) Big changes
If you are making big changes, please explain the changes in your pull request and give an overview of why you've decided to make them. I will try the changes myself to see if I like them before giving you my judgement

# How to Contribute
If you would like to contribute you most certainly can, simply clone the repository, make your changes in you favourite android based app studio of choice (I'm using android studio) and then create a pull request when you are done. If the change fits in with the [roadmap](https://github.com/jrmswell/subsonicradioandroid/projects/1) or I just like it then I will accept the changes

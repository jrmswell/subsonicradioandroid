# Update
Unfortunately, due to life getting in the way (cheifly University), I am shelving this project, I have made a few further updates here but nothing worth putting here. Maybe one day this will be updated again. Until then, see you in the future!

# Subsonicradio Android App
Subsonic Radio doesn't have an app anymore, let's do something about that. This is an unofficial project made by a fan of the site to make his life slightly easier

# How to Contribute
If you would like to contribute you most certainly can, simply clone the repository, make your changes in you favourite android based app studio of choice (I'm using android studio) and then create a pull request when you are done. If the change fits in with the [roadmap](https://github.com/jrmswell/subsonicradioandroid/projects/1) or I just like it then I will accept the changes

## Android Studio
I use android studio to develop the app and to say it has some quirks but for maximum compatibility I would recommend using that too
